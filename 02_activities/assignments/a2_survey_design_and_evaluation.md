# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Describe the purpose of your survey:

write your answer here...
The purpose of this survey is to understand the factors contributing to high turnover among entry and lower level employees at the company. The survey collects perceptions from both current and recently departed employees to identify issues related to job satisfaction, management, workload, compensation, and career development. The findings will inform the company to undertake targeted interventions to improve staff retention and satisfaction. 
Depending on the size of the company, a census or simple random sampling can be used. Bifercation can be made between current and former employees by asking a question about their employment status.

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
write your answer here...
Target population: Entry and low level employees currently employed or left within the past 12 months
Sampling Frame: HR database containing contact information for current and former employees
Sampling unit: Individuals employees (current or former)
Observational units: Individual employee responses about their experience and perception at the company

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. What is your current employment status with the company? 
    a) Current employee
    b) Former employee (left within 12 months)
2. How would you rate your satisfaction while working at the company?
    1 = Very dissatisfied, 10 = Very satisfied
3. How would you rate your workload?
    1 = Difficult to manage, 10 = Easily manageable
4. How supported do/did you feel by your direct manager?
    1 = Not supported at all, 10 = Fully supported
5. How satisfied are/were you with the compensation and benefits?
    1 = Very dissatisfied, 10 = Very satisfied
6. How would you rate the opportunities for growth and development at the company?
    1 = No opportunities, 10 = Excellent opportunities
7. How likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work?
    1 = Not likely, 10 = Very likely
8. On a scale of 1 to 10, rate the following factors that may influence your decision to leave
    1 = Not influential, 10 = Very influential
    a) Compensation
    b) Workload
    c) Growth opportunities
    d) Professional development
    e) Managerial support
    f) Workplace culture
    g) Other: Specify and rate

The 2018 GSS GVP collected data from persons aged 15 years and over living in private households in Canada, excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut and full time residents of institutions.
1. Sample type: It is a cross-sectional survey collecting data at a single point in time. The sample is based on a stratified design employing probability sampling. The stratification is done at the province/census metropolitan area (CMA) level. 

2. Sample size: The sample included 16,149 respondents aged 15 and above. According to the documents, a field sample of approximatively 50,000 units was used. Among them, about 40,000 invitation letters to the electronic questionnaire were sent to selected households across Canada. A completion of 24,000 questionnaires was expected. 

3. Target population: All individuals aged 15 and above living in private households in 10 provinces of Canada, excluding full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions.

4. Sampling frame: The frame for GSS was created using several linked sources, such as the Census, administrative data and billing files.The sampling frame uses address and telephone registers to generate a list of households eligible for selection. The methodological design integrates multiple sources (e.g., telephone number listings and address registers) to cover households across Canada.

5. Survey mode(s): The survey was administered using online electronic questionnaire, or through CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing). It was the first time that GSS used an online option for the respondents. The respondents could choose between French and English and the average time to complete the survey was estimated at 44 minutes.

6. Timeline: Data collection for this reference period: 2018-09-04 to 2018-12-28

7. Response rate: The overall response rate is 41.9%

8. Weights: Survey weights were used to adjust for non-response and to ensure estimates are representative of the target population.
Additional adjustments used administrative data (e.g., income, household composition) to reduce non-response bias. Weights ensure survey estimates represent the official target population

9. Data processing: Data was collected via telephone interviews or self-completed electronic questionnaires. Responses were edited and coded for consistency. Bootstrap weights were generated to estimate sampling variability, and survey weights applied to adjust for non-response and coverage error.

10. Cleaning, imputation, etc: Except for a few cases, all imputations were made using donor records selected through a score function. Each non-responding record was matched to the “nearest” donor record based on shared characteristics. If donor-based imputation was not possible, mean imputation among donor records was used.
Imputation was carried out in 9 steps. The first step consisted of imputing personal income and family income. The next three steps involved imputing the formal volunteering variables in the master file. Steps five and six were imputing the informal volunteering variables in the master file. Finally, the last three steps involved imputing variables in the donation file and the solicitation methods in the master file.
Personal income questions were not asked in the survey but the information was obtained by linkage to the tax data for those who had not objected. Personal data of 81.9 per cent was obtained from T1FF while missing information for others was imputed. Overall a family income value was obtained for 81.7 per cent of households. Missing information for other respondents was imputed.

11. Sources of error: The methodology of this survey has been designed to limit the number of errors and to reduce their potential effects. However, the results of the survey remain subject to both sampling and non-sampling error
    Sampling error: Estimates vary across samples; bootstrap method used to quantify variability. Estimates with high sampling variability are indicated in this publication and all of the highlighted differences between subgroups of the population are significant at the 95% level.

    Non-sampling error: Common sources of these errors are imperfect coverage and non-response.
    Coverage error: Some households without telephones were excluded. Survey estimates were adjusted (weighted) to represent all persons in the target population, including those not covered by the survey frame.
    Non-response error at household and individual level was mitigated through weighting. 
    Other non-sampling errors: Efforts were made to minimize bias by used a well-tested questionnaire, a proven methodology, specialized interviews and strict quality control. 

12. Limitations, known biases, etc:
    Imperfect coverage: households without telephones excluded, residual undercoverage or overcoverage may exist
    Non-response bias: weights reduce but may not fully eliminate bias
    Low response rate: 41.9% may leave potential for bias
    Methodological changes (e.g., new Internet survey option in 2018) limit comparability with earlier cycles
